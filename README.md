- The Industrial Robotics project involved the design and implementation on MATLAB of two trajectories (triangle and circumference) in space for an industrial manipulator (PUMA 560).
- The Mobile Robotics project involved the design and implementation on MATLAB of Path Planning techniques (Artificial Potential Fields, Discrete Potential Fields, Voronoi Diagrams, Visibility Graphs), Trajectory Tracking control techniques (Approximated Linearization, Non-Linear Control, Input-Output/Feedback Linearization) and Posture Regulation (Cartesian Regulation and Complete Regulation) for a unicycle type mobile robot.
